Voice-Cloner is an AI-powered deep learning model that can replicate a person's voice using a short audio sample. It employs state-of-the-art speech synthesis and voice cloning techniques to generate high-quality, natural-sounding speech.

## Features
- **Few-shot Voice Cloning**: Generate a cloned voice with minimal data.
- **Deep Learning-Based**: Uses advanced neural networks for voice synthesis.
- **Customizable Output**: Adjust pitch, tone, and speed of the cloned voice.
- **Fast Processing**: Real-time or near real-time voice synthesis.
